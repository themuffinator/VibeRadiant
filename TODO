## Indexed details

1. Rotate dialog non-modal: Make the rotate dialog non-modal so it can stay open while editing.
2. MSI installer new folder hang: Resolved by dropping MSI packaging in favor of zip releases + the in-app updater, so the MSI directory picker no longer applies.
3. GTK2 bitmap font crash: Resolved; the GTK2 code path is no longer used in the Qt-based editor, so the GTK2 bitmap-font crash no longer applies.
4. GTK2 alt-tab: Resolved; Qt-based input handling replaced the GTK2 event path, so the GTK2 alt-tab issue no longer applies.
5. Floating-windows resolution change: Resolved by clamping restored floating-window geometry into the available screen bounds after resolution changes.
6. HalfLife Q1 map format: Resolved; `mapq1` supports Quake1 and Valve220 brush formats with auto-detection, enabling HL Q1 maps and conversion by toggling brush format on save.
7. Entity creation brush loss: Resolved by only reparenting selected world brushes when creating a new brush entity, leaving brushes in other entities untouched.
8. SConscript SETUP=1: Resolved by retiring the SCons build path; Makefile is the supported build entry point.
9. SConscript svn.py locale: Resolved by retiring the SCons build path; svn.py is no longer used in builds.
10. Capslock arrow keys: Resolved by ignoring Caps Lock state for key-move handling so navigation still works.
11. Screensaver assertion: Resolved; the GTK2 GDK GC path is no longer used in the Qt-based editor.
12. Paint-select: Add paint-select or occlusion-aware area selection for fast brush picking.
13. Select-complete-tall: Add select-complete-tall and/or a subtract-from-selection modifier key.
14. Texture pane names: Fix text overlap so names do not collide with each other or outline rectangles.
15. Build-menu XML docs: Document the build menu XML format, variable substitution, and examples used by Build > Customize.

    The build menu is fully customizable; you can run qbsp3/qvis3/arghrad or any tool you want via Build > Customize.

    Menu commands are the shell commands Radiant executes when you choose a menu item. You can add multiple commands to a
    single menu item, and they run in sequence. Commands contain variables in [] which are substituted when executed.

    Example command:
    ```
    [q2map] -bsp "[MapFile]"
    ```

    Example expansion:
    ```
    "C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant 1.5.0\q2map" -fs_basepath "c:\quake2" -bsp "c:\quake2\baseq2\maps\blah.map"
    ```

    This uses the predefined `MapFile` variable and the custom `q2map` variable. `q2map` is defined in the XML file, and
    `MapFile` is the full path to your map.

    Custom variable example:
    ```
    <var name="arghrad">"[RadiantPath]arghrad"</var>
    ```

    Custom variables can only be added by editing the XML file.

    Usage:
    ```
    [arghrad] "[MapFile]"
    ```

    Note: `MapFile` is quoted because paths may contain spaces.
16. Filter non-world entities: Add an option to filter non-world entities (not func_group/func_static).

18. Brush/patch paint shortcut: Add MMB+Ctrl to paint the texture onto the whole brush or patch.
19. Camera highlighting styles: Add alternative camera highlight styles (used to be bound to J).
20. Doom3 spline movers: Add a filter for func_splinemovers.
21. Connection-line arrowheads: Draw arrowheads to show direction on connection lines.
22. MMB texture apply: When MMB selecting a texture, also apply it to all selected faces.
23. Two-button mouse: Support two-button mouse input where possible.
24. Grid background color: Change grid background color when the smallest grid is invisible due to zoom.
25. Face dots toggle: Option to disable dots on selected faces when not in face mode.
26. func_door/func_button angle arrows: Draw direction arrows for func_door and func_button angle.
27. Build menu variable editing: Support editing build menu variables in the UI.
28. Doom3 multi-bumpmaps: For materials with multiple bumpmap stages, use the first stage and ignore later stages.
29. Negative volume warning: Warn when a brush is dragged into a configuration with <0 volume.
30. Default new-brush texture: Add option to give new brushes a specific texture instead of the last selected.
31. QE-tool drag anywhere: Allow clicking anywhere on the XY view to drag an entity, not only on the entity.
32. UserDocs multi-vertex selection: Document multi-vertex selection, replacing vertex-edit-splits-faces.

45. Shader addnormals: Add support for the addnormals keyword (e.g. models/mapobjects/healthgui/healthguidirty).

47. Module system refresh: Reinstate the module-system refresh feature.
48. Surface Inspector axial button: Add an axial projection button for Doom3.
49. Engine-launch commands: Fix hardcoded engine-launch commands by using the build-menu variable system.
